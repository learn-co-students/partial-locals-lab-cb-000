<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:

<!-- if the test is failing when it shouldnt, build the final desired outcome ??
frustrating -->
<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
<%end %>
