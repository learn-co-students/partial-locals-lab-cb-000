<!--
The way the Rspec test is written, it ignores the perfectly valid @students = @classroom.students assignment in the controller, necessitating repetition of that assignment in the view. 

@students.each do… works perfectly in-browser, but Rspec thinks the value of @students is nil. Maybe because it is using a render call instead of actually visiting the path, which would go through the controller, and thus set @students for use by the view… ?
